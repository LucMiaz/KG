ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a study of automatic detection and recognition of tonal bird sounds in noisy environments. The detection of spectro-temporal regions containing bird tonal vocalisations is based on exploiting the spectral shape to identify sinusoidal components in the short-time spectrum. The detection method provides tonal-based feature representation that is employed for automatic bird recognition. The recognition system uses Gaussian mixture models to model 165 different bird syllables, produced by 95 bird species. Standard models, as well as models compensating for the effect of the noise, are employed. Experiments are performed on bird sound recordings corrupted by White noise and real-world environmental noise. The proposed detection method shows high detection accuracy of bird tonal components. The employed tonal-based features show significant recognition accuracy improvements over the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, in both standard and noise-compensated models, and strong robustness to mismatch between the training and testing conditions.},
